# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites:
- QT 5.2 or later
  - download version for your environment from
    http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

## Installing QT:
This is only one way that worked on Ubuntu 14.04 - if in doubt, follow
the instructions on http://qt-project.org

- E.g. download the Qt Online Installer for Linux (32-bit or 64-bit,
  depending on your system); for me (with Qt 5.1), the file name was
  qt-linux-opensource-1.4.0-2-x86_64-online.run. Adapt the following to
  the current file name.

```
 chmod +x qt-linux-opensource-1.4.0-2-x86_64-online.run
 sudo qt-linux-opensource-1.4.0-2-x86_64-online.run
 PATH=/opt/Qt/5.3/gcc_64/bin:$PATH	# adapt to your needs,
 # put it into $HOME/.profile or similar
```

## Checking out the code:
You can check out the code (and binary libraries) with a command similar
to:

```
  git clone https://infXXXX@atlas.ai.it.fh-worms.de/bitbucket/scm/tst/googlemock-hello.git
```

## Preparations:
Generate your platform specific build environment using cmake started
from a command line prompt (bash on Linux / Mac OS X; cmd or PowerShell
or Cygwin on Windows):

```
  cd build
  qmake ../src/hello-googlemock.pro CONFIG+=debug	# generates Makefile
```

Visual Studio (not yet tested):

```
  cd build
  qmake -tp vc ../src/hello-googlemock.pro	# should create Visual Studio project!?
```

## Building the application and the unit test program:
```
  cd build      # only if not already there
  make          # generates all
  ./helloworld  # enjoy the famous program
  ./unit-test   #
  make clean    # optionally, remove all temporary files
```

## Cleaning the build directory:
- initially the build directory is empty, so all files there are
  generated by the build - and if you didn't save anything there, you
  can safely remove all files by using rm
- alternatively, just remove the files built by 'make':

```
  cd build		# only if not already there
  make clean		# optionally, remove all temporary files
  make distclean	# as clean, but removes also libs and Makefiles
```
